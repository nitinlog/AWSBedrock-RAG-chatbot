##  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
# Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for documents (PDFs). The system allows an admin to upload PDF files containing content, which are then processed and indexed to enable fast semantic search and question answering.

The pipeline uses AWS services, LangChain, and Amazon Bedrock for embeddings, storing vector indices for efficient retrieval.
